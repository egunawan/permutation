1. Create a very simple math object.
- example: permutation on [n]
2. Create classes for contributing to Sage: NoncrossingPartitions
- Sage is powerful - we can build on top of others’ work - don’t reinvent the wheel.
- Create a parent class for your object
.. parent class: enumerate all noncrossing partitions of [n]
.. element class: a noncrossing partition of [n]
